# How to Wire a House with Cat 6 Cable

## Materials Needed
1. Cat 6 cable
2. RJ-45 connectors
3. Crimping tool
4. Network face plates and network jacks

## Instructions 
1. **Planning your network layout**: Decide where you want your network outlets to be in your house and identify a central location for your network hub. Your hub should ideally be in a location that is easy to work in with easy access to power outlets.
   
2. **Running the cable**: Drill holes in your wall plates where you want your network outlets to be. Run your Cat 6 cable from the network hub to each of the network outlet locations. Leave some slack at each end to make the job of attaching connectors easier.

3. **Adding connectors**: At the network hub end of each cable, attach a RJ-45 connector using your crimping tool. At the network outlet end, attach the cable to a network jack, and then attach this to the network face plate.

4. **Testing your network**: Once all connectors are attached, test each outlet to make sure it is working correctly.

**Note:** While running cables through walls and ceilings, always adhere to local building codes and safety regulations. Hiring a professional is recommended if you are not confident in doing this kind of work.
