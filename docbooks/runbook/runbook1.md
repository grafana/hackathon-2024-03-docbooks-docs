# Resolving 'Unable to compile due to insufficient cpu' Error

1. Check your CPU usage
    - Open your system's Task Manager (on windows) or System Monitor (on Linux) and check if your CPU usage is high. If it's close to 100%, that may be the cause of the error.

2. Close Unnecessary Applications
    - If your CPU usage is high, close any unnecessary applications, especially those which are using a significant amount of your CPU's power.

3. Increase your system's resources
    - If closing applications doesn't help or isn't an option, you may need to upgrade your computer's hardware. Increasing RAM or switching to a more powerful CPU could solve your problem.

4. Enable multi-threading if your compiler has this option
    - Some compilers have an option to compile on multiple CPU cores. Enabling this feature may help if you're dealing with a large project.

5. Allocate more resources to your IDE
    - If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, you can increase the amount of memory allocated to it from the settings.

Please remember these are just potential fixes and might not necessarily solve your specific issue.
